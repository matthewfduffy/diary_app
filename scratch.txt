python manage.py migrate

# Start Local Server
`$ python manage.py runserver`


# Create an App

`$ python manage.py startapp entries`

Creates a new folder in project with predefined files. Only 3 of the files need to be touched:

entries/__init__.py
entries/admin.py  **
entries/apps.py
entries/models.py  **
entries/tests.py
entries/views.py  **

At this point, Django doesn't know the app that was just created.
To connect the `entries` app to the `diary` project, add the _configuration class_ to the beginning of the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in `diary/settings.py`
